# Distance-measurement_system

It is a system to measure the distance using ultrasonic sensor 
HC-SR04 with the specifications listed below:

1. Using ATmega32 Microcontroller with frequency 8Mhz

2.The LCD should display the distance value by cm.

3.The project is designed and implemented based on the layered architecture 
model as follow:

-DIO, ICU drivers in the MCAL layer.

-LCD , Ultrasonic sensor drivers in the HAL layer.
